# age-classification
The **Age Classification Using Deep Learning** project classifies faces into age groups using models like VGG-16  with attention-based feature fusion. It applies preprocessing techniques like face alignment, normalization, and augmentation. Built with TensorFlow/PyTorch, it supports real-time predictions and web API deployment.
